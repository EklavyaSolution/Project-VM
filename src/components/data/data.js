    review: "Venky is one of the nicest people you will come across in the hour of need. He has helped me by going out of the way in explaining how things work and how to overcome obstacles that come your way. I got in touch with Venky through google search and I cannot express my gratitude to having found him at the right time. If you really want to get a positive change in life and work with someone who truly is passionate about this subject reach out to him. You will not be disappointed imo. Numerology is his passion and it shows in his work.",
